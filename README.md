# iUL959 analysis with Jupyter Notebook

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/uliebal/iUL959/master) [![colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/uliebal/iUL959/blob/master/iUL959_JupyterNotebook.ipynb)

This notebook is an extension to the article by Liebal et al., (2019) and reproduces the comparison of experimental growth rates with predictions by the genome scale metabolic model (GSMM) of Ogataea polymorpha iUL959.

The Additional Information file (iUL959_GSMM-adinfo.xlsx) containing the published growth rates and substrate uptake rates are already present in the Github folder. You need to upload iUL959 seperately to the Jupyter Notebook instance.
